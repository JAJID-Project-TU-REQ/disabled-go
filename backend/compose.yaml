# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose

# MySQL database configuration
# `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to start the database before your application.
# The `db-data` volume persists the database data between container restarts.
# The `db-password` secret is used to set the database password.
# You must create `db/password.txt` and add a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
